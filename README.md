# Data Modelling Challenges 
Merging data between existing large data sources                                                                                                                                                                        
Remove Null and Blanks                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Validating data accuracy                                                                                                                                                                                                
Converting data into proper Data-Type Specially for date field                                                                                                                                                          
Adding or correcting missing entries ,Columns                                                                                                                                                                            
# Observation 
1. Highest Load factor on carrier Globespan Airways with 94.76%
2. Carriers with consistently high load factors indicate effective capacity management and strong demand for their services
3. higher Load is observed on weekend due to seasonal vacation & weekday during rush hours when people commute to work or industrial and commercial activities
4. In Top Routes Chicago to Detroit has maximum number of flights departures i.e. 95 whereas 2nd top route is Washington to new York has 88 flights departures.
5. number of flights in each distance group can reveal the role of airports and airlines as hubs for connecting different regions
6. Short-haul flights may have a higher frequency 

# Suggestion
1. Customer happiness is a critical indicator in every business.                                                                                                                                                      
2. ensuring an efficient balance between demand and available capacity.                                                                                                                                               
3. Allocate resources more effectively by focusing on routes and flights with consistently high load factors.                                                                                                         
4. All factors are related with United States, This has to be improved.                                                                                                                                               
5. Highest number of flights are flying for shortest Distance(Less than 500 miles) this has to be improved.                                                                                                           
6. Find ways to do things faster and better, especially on routes where a lot of people want to fly.                                                                                                                  
7. Think about using different types of planes for short trips to make sure they're the most efficient and cost-effective                                                                                             
8. Collaborate with partner airlines or travel agencies based on load factor insights

# What I Learnt                                                                                                                                                                                                      
1. Create Interactive Dashboard
2. Mearge or Join Multiple Table
3. Used Calculated field for formulas with various condition
4. Excel: Power Query to clean Data , Pivot Table , Macros , Dropdown list added for year,month & quarter
5. Power BI: Used DAX, creating group, Bookmark, Page Navigation
6. Tableau: creating group, sets, Dynamic Zooning, Calculated Field
